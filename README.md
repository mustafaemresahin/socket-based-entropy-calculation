# Socket-Based Incremental Entropy Calculator (PA2)

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a distributed version of the multithreaded incremental entropy algorithm, incorporating interprocess communication using sockets in UNIX. It's an extension of the first programming assignment, now allowing communication between a client and server program. This project was developed as part of my Operating Systems course at the University of Houston.

## Objective
The goal is to demonstrate the use of sockets for interprocess communication in a UNIX environment. This involves a client program sending task scheduling information to a server program, which calculates the entropy using the incremental entropy algorithm and returns the results.
